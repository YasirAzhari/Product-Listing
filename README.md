# Product-Listing
A product page for Code Banana
Hosted at : https://solo-proj.netlify.app
This was my introductoin to React JS. It's a simple webpage layout. It calls the company API and populates the page with products.

Through this project I learned:
* React basics
* The use of Axios to connect with APIs
* Creating a dynamic webpage through the UseState hook

## Addition

This is also the solo project for my application to chingu.io. I don't really intend to pursue frontened development but this is the only complete and hosted SOLO project I have as of right now.
