# Product-Listing

## Overview
A product page for Cold Banana.

This was my introductoin to React JS. It's a simple webpage layout. It calls the company API and populates the page with products. (I am now submitting this as my solo project to join Chungu.io)

## Features

* Uses Axios to connect with the API
* Dynamically populates the product listing through the UseState hook
* Infinitely loads more dummy data as the user clicks the load products button.

## Running the project

Run <code>npm start</code> in the terminal. On the page, you can click on the button that says load products to view more of the products.

## Dependencies
The code calls the following API: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/TomSearle/cb-devtest-api/products
